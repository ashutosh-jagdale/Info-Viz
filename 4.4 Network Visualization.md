## 4.4 Network Visualizations

The network analysis mapped relationships between job roles and required skills, using the **LinkedIn Job Posts Insights Dataset**.  
Two types of networks were created: a **Career Pathway Network** showing job transitions and a **Job-to-Skill Relationship Network** showing key skill requirements.

### **Stakeholder Impact:**  
- **Job Seekers:** Explored career growth opportunities.  
- **Educators:** Mapped skills to job roles for curriculum design.  
- **Employers:** Identified skill gaps for training.
